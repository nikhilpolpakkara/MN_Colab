The string "KfAxU8AyU8SstxS16SstyU16WU16" appears to represent the data type or format for a characteristic or axis
within an A2L file.

In A2L files, data types are defined using specific keywords or codes that specify how the data is structured and stored.
 Each letter or combination of letters in this string likely represents a particular data type or encoding used in the
 calibration parameters.

Breaking down the string:

Kf: Indicates a float value (likely a 32-bit floating-point number).
AxU8: Suggests a combination or structure that might include an axis (A) and an 8-bit unsigned integer (U8).
AyU8: Similar to the previous but likely represents another axis (A) and an 8-bit unsigned integer (U8).
Sstx: Could imply a signed 16-bit integer for an axis (S) with linear scaling (stx).
S16: Indicates a signed 16-bit integer.
SstyU16: Likely a signed 16-bit integer (S16) with scaling (sty) followed by an unsigned 16-bit integer (U16).
WU16: This might denote another data format, potentially a word (W) followed by an unsigned 16-bit integer (U16).
Each of these codes or combinations represents a specific data type or format used to describe the structure, encoding,
or scaling of calibration parameters within the A2L file. The actual meaning and interpretation of these codes depend on
the conventions and specifications defined in the A2L standard or the specific context of the calibration within the
automotive system.
